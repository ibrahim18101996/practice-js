 - i will take about why JS make website more interactive .
 - access content : content of the page
 - modify content : content of the page 
 - programe rules : rules the browser can follow 
 - reaet to events : triggered by the users 

* JS make webpages feel intraevtive by responding to what the user does by using traditional rules .
 - script is series of instruction .
 - to write ascript we need to stste our goal and then list the task we need .
 - the element of JS :
      * number (0-9) 
      * string (text) 
      * values (true or fales)
 - function : series of ststement to preform atask and we can use it many time .
